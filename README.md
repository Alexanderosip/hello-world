Fashion, culture, identity and femininity: how trends affect our everyday life?

There's no doubt that our life is always full of various significant events. They all form the reality we live in, and our opinion on it. Naturally, it leads to the emergence of new social and political movements, as well as fresh art and music styles. And those small steps that we take on the way to big changes, we call them "trends" - current preferences of the majority.

In my opinion, they affect people a lot â€“ the gregarious instinct is one of our primary ones, human tends to heed and share the opinion of the best part. Because of that, we're faced with trends in each and every walk of life.

First of all, they influence people's culture and social behaviour. Evidently, everything that becomes a popular trend on the Internet is immediately projected on our real actions and communication patterns. For example, jokes, memes, and even Tik Tok sounds and dances! As they are cool, funny and hip, they are ubiquitously used - in conversations among friends, TV commercials, marketing designs, etc.

Secondly, trends are an integral part of fashion. New designs come out every season, and are sold out within minutes! People are used to thinking that brand new clothes make them more good-looking and attractive.

However, it's not always like that. Some fashion trends suit not all body, hair, face types, so you should be selective. To my mind, it's much better to find your own style. I mean, maybe a short, fair-haired curvy white girl should choose what looks good on her, not just copy a look of a skinny, curly black model, even though both of them are beautiful. Their beauty is different.

I also think that such excessive trends obsession distorts the concept of femininity. 10 years ago girls used to think it lies in short skirts and decolleted blouses. Now, they prefer oversized hoodies and men's suits instead, to emphasize their delicacy and fragility. But it's still not the point, the true femininity lies inside, and has nothing to do with outfits. Probably, women forgot about it because of fashion industry influence - brands need to sell each collection produced to match one of the fleeting trends.
It appears that even in science there are trends. Once a company invents a new technology, other companies start developing it, so it becomes the basis for further researches. Social opinion and activities are also affected. Since the Internet appeared, if one person shares the idea, others tend to take it up, so it becomes common.

Summing up all said above, trends matter for our identity. Even though we consider ourselves to be independent, we still keep up with our world's updates - our decisions are not that ours in fact. It's impossible to escape trends, to zone out completely. Is that bad? I don't think so. It's just the echo of the evolutionary process. So, there's no need to be afraid of new trends, try them first, and...
